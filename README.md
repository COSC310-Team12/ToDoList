# ToDoList

I made a separate branch for the layouts and added branch protection. Please make branches for your changes in the future, you will not be able to commit to main directly. Instead, you should make a pull-request after pushing your branch.

The layout changes are in the LayoutDesigns branch, and we have two current prototypes.
